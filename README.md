# *Hey there, I'm Joker!*

### Just some brilliant person who loves programming and lots of RPG's!
---

Just a game developer who loves the OMORI, Metroidvania's, RPG's, Retro Stuff, Programming, etc.

I've been fascinated for game development for a long time, however have never found true motivations for certain projects, so I'm kind of a on-and-off programmer!
